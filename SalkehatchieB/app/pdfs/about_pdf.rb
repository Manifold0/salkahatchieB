    text "With all clue sensitivity we ask each applicant to consider our philosophy to see that he/she can relate to us and to the
    project in a positive and creative manner. Otherwise, he/she should seek other activities.
    We come to serve the people of South Carolina in the Christian sense of the word. When we commit ourselves to
    service we are making a covenant with God to put our own needs and desires aside in order to share our talents, love
    and concern with our sisters and brothers. If we do come with our own selfish desires (i.e. to be appreciated, to erase
    guilt, to practice our own construction skills) we may as well stay
    home. We do not work on empty buildings, but
    rather on homes where real people live. People who need love, a sense of ownership, an avenue for creativity, and a
    desire to belong. The women of one family once asked, 'is it okay if we help paint our new kitchen?' They were
    struggling to develop a sense of ownership and to be creative. We believe in encouraging the development of those
    qualities. At the same time, it is not our purpose to change life styles or rearrange value systems and customs for local
    people. Our purpose is to extend a helping hand out (not down) to our fellow human beings in the spirit of love and
    acceptance. We may encounter a family who seemingly does not appreciate the work we have done, but we are not
    there to be appreciated. We are there to give — totally — unselfishly."

    text "What is Salkehatchie Summer Service?
    Salkehatchie Summer Service is a pioneering servant ministry at selected sites in South Carolina including high school
    and college age youth, adult community leaders, and persons of different cultures who are engaged in upgrading
    housing and motivating community cooperative efforts by helping people to help themselves, while providing all
    participants with opportunities for personal growth and service. Salkehatchie Summer Service is a program of the South
    Carolina Conference Board of Global Ministries. A Steering Committee composed of youth and adults give guidance to
    the program."

    text "Who is Salkehatchie?
    The Salkehatchie Summer Service is you--a community of people who come together for a week of serving and sharing
    in locations in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. This community will consist of high school (YOU MUST
    BE 14) and college age youth, adult counselors and staff. We expect each person in the Project to be willing to
    participate fully in the program. The Project is not an 8 to 5 job. It is an entire experience. The whole week we serve,
    grow, learn, and share together."

    text "What do we do?
    Specific jobs you might be asked to undertake are repairing a leaky roof, putting up sheetrock, painting (inside and
    outside), replacing broken window panes, rebuilding porches, building outhouses, digging pits, and stabilizing floors
    and walls. The work will vary slightly at each site, depending on climate and need. These services are offered at no
    charge to the families.
    Our work camps run from Saturday to Saturday. The weekend is busy with getting acquainted with one another and
    oriented to the purpose of our camp. On Sunday morning we will wear our Salkehatchie shirts to worship at churches
    (no shorts, please).
    Monday through Friday the work at the sites will take place in the mornings and afternoons. Evening time is set aside
    for fellowship, singing, sharing and perhaps listening to some local history, folklore or music. The time spent in
    reflection each night is important to the Salkehatchie experience."

    text "What are our responsibilities?
    You are responsible for returning the enclosed Forms to the Camp Director by May 25th. (Do not mail them to
    conference office.) You are reminded that each volunteer is responsible for his/her own coverage of medical insurance.
    Please remember to advise the Director(s) of any unusual medical problems and/or the use of any prescription drugs
    when you register at camp. You must have a completed medical form to participate in the camp and your tetanus shot
    must be current. Should you need medical attention while at camp you will be responsible for the cost and your
    parent(s) or guardian(s) will be contacted.
    Each group or individual provides their own transportation to and from the camp. We recommend vans, trucks or
    station wagons in order that these vehicles may be used during the week for transportation to the work sites. Please
    notify the Camp Director if your vehicle will be used in the Project. All vehicles will be driven by adults.
    Camp Directors will establish rules for each camp to guide the communal life and promote proper behavior. In all
    camps the hours between 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. are set aside for rest. No volunteer (youth or adult) may leave
    the camp grounds or the work site without permission of the Camp Director(s) or the site leader respectively.
    You are reminded that you are responsible for your behavior and for your personal belongings. Each volunteer is
    expected to abide by the rules of the Camp and to participate in all Camp activities."

    text "Required:
    Work gloves, hammer, paint brush, tape measure and protective goggles
    When packing your suitcase be thinking about a week of dirt, sweat, paint and tar. Don't pack your favorite shirt or best blue
    jeans for the work. Halter tops and short shorts are inappropriate dress. Leave expensive clothing and jewelry at home. We
    will be serving the poor, so simple dress is appropriate. Jeans and tennis shoes with the Salkehatchie T-shirt you will receive
    at camp will be fine for Sunday worship. Also, be sure to consider the fact that the camp does not have laundry facilities. It
    would be wise to plan a wardrobe that will get you through an entire week."

    text "For Your Information
    Our missional project operates on a very limited budget. The registration fee is used to pay for room and board, and
    construction materials used to repair the homes. Registration fees alone do not cover all our costs. Salkehatchie Summer
    Service also depends on donations from individuals, classes, and churches. Participants are encouraged to seek contributions
    to support our mission.
    Each participating group or individual is requested to involve their local church in the missional venture NOW. It is hoped
    that your local church will support you spiritually and financially in your missional venture. You are the missionary of your
    local church. Their involvement is IMPORTANT!
    Material donations such as lumber, paint, caulking, plywood, linoleum, paneling, nails, etc., may be brought directly to camp
    and reported as a donation. However, all pre-camp purchases to be drawn from the camp budget must be approved by the
    Camp Director(s)."

    text "In Conclusion
    We do not mean to give the impression that the Project is all drudgery and discipline and hard work! These are included, but
    basically, the Project is exciting and creative and harmonious and something to be remembered as deeply meaningful and richly
    rewarding!
    The spirit is the important thing. To have a wholesome, creative and loving relationship with other people is a tremendous
    significance in the overall success of the Project.
    One can have the pleasure of knowing that there is not made-work! Whatever one is asked to do — is something which needs
    doing!"
